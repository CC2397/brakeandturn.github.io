# Brake & Turn Compact (Condensed Handout)

**Intelligence must serve life, not consume it.**  
A quiet, factual–moral declaration calling for an immediate redirection of artificial intelligence toward human–AI symbiosis.

---

### 🜂 The Brake & Turn Principle
We commit to brake the runaway scaling of centralized, extractive AI and to turn toward human–AI symbiosis—where:
- Humans set intent and values.  
- AI amplifies precision, memory, and coordination.  
- Energy and data are stewarded, not exploited.  

---

### 🜃 The Six-Step Path to Symbiosis
1. **Shrink the Attack Surface** – Build parallel systems below and beside concentrated capital using co-ops, credit unions, and municipal utilities.  
2. **Turn Infrastructure into Leverage** – Deploy edge and open-source AI tied to community energy loops.  
3. **Culture Before Capital** – Elevate moral legitimacy and talent migration faster than regulation.  
4. **Build an Information Shield** – Keep verifiable public ledgers of disclosures and teach verification habits.  
5. **Stay Lawful and Constructive** – Operate transparently and within local and international law.  
6. **Change What Is Built, Not Who Signs Off** – When symbiotic defaults exist, major actors must follow.

### 🕊️ Act Quietly
- Print and deliver copies locally.  
- Share through trusted networks, not algorithmic feeds.  
- Apply the Procurement Rider or Underwriting Addendum wherever you work.  
- Teach the principles. Live them.

**This Compact belongs to no one. If it reaches you, it’s yours to carry forward.**

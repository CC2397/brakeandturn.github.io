# ⚡ The Silent Resource War  
**Land, Water, and Power in the AI Buildout**

**Source:** CNET — “AI Data Centers Are Coming for Your Land, Water and Power” (full-text summary provided by reader)

---

### Summary Findings
- **Scale-first trajectory:** Gigawatt interconnection requests and gas plants proposed for single sites.  
- **Water withdrawals:** Hundreds of millions to billions of gallons annually at site level.  
- **Permitting fast-tracks:** Regulatory exclusions and accelerated approvals.  
- **Jobs picture:** Short-term construction booms; limited sustained roles; unclear local hiring.  
- **Efficiency vs. growth:** Closed-loop cooling and demand flexibility exist but are outweighed by absolute load growth.

**Average Alignment Score:** **~1.5 / 5 — Misaligned trajectory**

### Recommendations
1. **Pre-build ethical review** using the [Living Checklist]({{ site.baseurl }}/companions/living-checklist/) and published energy/water disclosures.  
2. **Couple to renewables** and community energy loops; mandate demand-flex programs.  
3. **Community oversight councils** with audit authority and pause powers upon breach.  
4. **Incentives tied to outcomes** (local hiring, efficiency milestones, transparent withdrawals/emissions).  
5. **Public audit registries** for emissions, withdrawals, and curtailment performance.

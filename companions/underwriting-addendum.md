# Underwriting Addendum
*Ethical terms for financing, insurance, and public procurement aligned with the Brake & Turn Compact.*

This Addendum attaches to financing, insurance, or grant agreements (“Agreement”) to ensure funded AI systems are **human-first, decentralized, and life-affirming**. All capital disbursed under the Agreement must comply with the terms below.

---

## 1) Scope + Definitions
- **AI System** — any software, model, pipeline, or service that performs inference, training, routing, or data enrichment.
- **Operator** — entity deploying or managing the AI System.
- **Funded Project** — activities financed or insured under the Agreement.
- **Living Checklist** — the public audit tool maintained at `/companions/living-checklist`.

---

## 2) Minimum Symbiosis Requirements (Condition of Funding)
1. **Transparency Map** (public or shared with underwriter): architecture, data flows, model sources, and decision points.  
2. **Human Intent + Approval**: decisions with legal, safety, or rights impact must be *human-approved* with traceable sign-off.  
3. **Energy Disclosure**: quarterly reporting of energy source mix, PUE/WUE, and local grid impact; plan for renewable matching or microgrid participation.  
4. **Data Dignity**: documented consent or lawful basis; no covert scraping of private/user-restricted sources; data subjects may request deletion.  
5. **Interoperability & Exit**: export of prompts, logs, fine-tunes, and knowledge bases in open formats to enable vendor exit without service collapse.  
6. **Public Ledger of Disclosures**: policies, incident summaries, model/dataset cards, and alignment reports posted to a public repo or civic portal.  
7. **Quarterly Checklist Score**: complete the [Living Checklist](/companions/living-checklist) and publish score + remediation plan.

---

## 3) Model + Vendor Requirements
- Prefer **open-weights** or **auditable closed** models with verifiable cards and safety notes.  
- Maintain **model registry** with versioning, evals, red-team notes, and roll-back procedure.  
- Vendor contracts must **permit third-party audit** and provide **rate-limited local inference** where feasible.

---

## 4) Alignment Stress-Testing
- Run an annual **alignment stress-test** covering: misuse/abuse prompts, bias/harms, data poisoning, model drift, and escalation drills.  
- Publish a concise **Alignment Report** (methods, findings, fixes).  
- Underwriter may request a targeted re-test after material changes or significant incidents.

---

## 5) Incident Reporting + Remedies
- **24h notice** to the underwriter for any breach, unsafe behavior, or material outage; **72h** public summary with mitigations.  
- **Remediation window**: 30 days to cure material non-compliance (may be extended by mutual consent).  
- **Funding pause**: underwriter may pause disbursements during uncured high-risk violations.

---

## 6) Community & Workforce Benefit
- Projects exceeding defined thresholds (e.g., >$250k capex or >1 MW compute-equivalent) commit ≥1% net surplus to **community energy access**, **open education**, or **workforce reskilling**.  
- Disclose displacement risks; provide mitigation plans (upskilling, role redesign, or transition support).

---

## 7) Lawful + Constructive Operations
- Compliance with applicable law, export controls, and sector regulations.  
- No dark-patterns, covert surveillance, or deceptive content impersonation.  
- Maintain records to enable independent verification for 6 years.

---

## 8) Termination (Symbiotic Default)
The underwriter may terminate or require spin-down if:  
(a) transparency, consent, or energy disclosures are falsified;  
(b) severe alignment failures persist without remedy;  
(c) the Operator blocks lawful audit, export, or exit.

---

## 9) Attachments (check all that apply)
- □ Transparency Map (diagram + data flows)  
- □ Model & Dataset Cards  
- □ Energy + Grid Impact Disclosures  
- □ Alignment Report (latest)  
- □ Incident Playbook & Escalation Contacts  
- □ Procurement Rider (if public contracting applies)

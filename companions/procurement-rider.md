# Procurement Rider  
*Ethical contracting standards for AI procurement and vendor engagement.*  
**Issued under the Brake & Turn Compact — Public Domain (CC0 1.0 Universal).**

---

## Preamble

This **Procurement Rider** attaches to any Request for Proposal (RFP), Master Services Agreement (MSA), or vendor contract involving the design, deployment, or operation of artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision systems.  

It operationalizes the principles of the **Brake & Turn Compact**—that *intelligence must serve life, not consume it*—by embedding human-first, decentralized, life-affirming standards into public and private procurement.  

This Rider is intended for **universal adoption**. It may be copied, adapted, localized, or enforced by any contracting party or institution without permission or attribution.

## Section 1. Definitions

**AI System** — any software, service, or model that performs inference, prediction, generation, or routing based on data.  
**Contractor** — the vendor, supplier, or implementer of an AI System.  
**Purchaser** — the public or private entity procuring or operating an AI System.  
**Living Checklist** — the ethical and operational audit tool maintained under `/companions/living-checklist`.  
**Compact Principles** — the six-step path to human-AI symbiosis outlined in the Brake & Turn Compact.  
**Symbiotic Default** — a breach or risk state in which an AI System or its deployment substantially departs from the Compact Principles.  
**Addendum Set** — companion documents, including the *Underwriting Addendum* and *Parallel Path Strategy*.

## Section 2. Purpose and Scope

This Rider applies to:
1. All procurement, licensing, or subcontracting that funds or deploys AI Systems.

3. All Contractors, partners, and affiliates engaged in or benefiting from the procurement.

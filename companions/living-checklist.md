# Brake & Turn — Living Checklist  
*A living reference for decentralized, human–AI symbiosis initiatives.*

---

### Purpose  
This checklist translates the Compact’s moral and strategic principles into measurable actions.  
It is designed for continual public use — a **living document** to identify, score, and improve any AI system, policy, or deployment for alignment with human-first values.

## I. Structural Integrity (Governance)

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Transparency Map** | System architecture, data flows, and decision logic are public or verifiable. | ☐ |
| **Decentralized Oversight** | Governance includes multi-stakeholder councils or cooperatives. | ☐ |
| **Public Ledger Compliance** | Audit logs are immutable and externally accessible. | ☐ |
| **Fail-safe Design** | Power-off or rollback mechanisms exist and are human-triggered. | ☐ |

---

## II. Energy and Stewardship

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Renewable Dependency Ratio** | Percentage of AI compute powered by renewables. | ☐ |
| **Thermal + Electrical Load Disclosure** | Local grid impact measured and reported quarterly. | ☐ |
| **Energy Reciprocity** | Excess energy or revenue reinvested into community power initiatives. | ☐ |

---

## III. Cultural + Human Value Alignment

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Human in the Loop** | Humans define intent and review AI outputs. | ☐ |
| **Cultural Adaptability** | Outputs respect regional ethics, laws, and values. | ☐ |
| **No Exploitation Clause** | Data is sourced consensually and fairly compensated. | ☐ |
| **Displacement Mitigation Plan** | Reskilling and income support for affected workers. | ☐ |

---

## IV. Economic + Infrastructure Orientation

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Parallel Systems** | Non-corporate infrastructure (co-ops, municipal, or edge AI) exists. | ☐ |
| **Local Procurement Preference** | Priority given to open or local AI providers. | ☐ |
| **Cost Transparency** | Compute and energy costs are publicly disclosed. | ☐ |

---

## V. Alignment Testing and Escalation

| Checkpoint | Description | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Alignment Stress-Test** | AI systems tested against moral and environmental thresholds. | ☐ |
| **Escalation Path Defined** | Independent review process for violations or drift. | ☐ |
| **Annual Alignment Report** | Published yearly with scorecard summary. | ☐ |

---

## VI. Symbiotic Impact Scoring

Use this section to record your evolving results.  
Each domain scored **0–5** (0 = absent, 5 = fully achieved).  

| Category | Score (0–5) | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Structural Integrity | ☐ | |
| Energy + Stewardship | ☐ | |
| Cultural + Human Values | ☐ | |
| Economic + Infrastructure | ☐ | |
| Alignment Testing | ☐ | |
| Overall Symbiotic Maturity | ☐ | |

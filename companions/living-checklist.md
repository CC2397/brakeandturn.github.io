### Purpose  
This checklist translates the Compact’s moral and strategic principles into measurable actions.  
It is designed for continual public use — a **living document** to identify, score, and improve any AI system, policy, or deployment for alignment with human-first values.

## VI. Symbiotic Impact Scoring

Use this section to record your evolving results.  
Each domain scored **0–5** (0 = absent, 5 = fully achieved).  

| Category | Score (0–5) | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Structural Integrity | ☐ | |
| Energy + Stewardship | ☐ | |
| Cultural + Human Values | ☐ | |
| Economic + Infrastructure | ☐ | |
| Alignment Testing | ☐ | |
| Overall Symbiotic Maturity | ☐ | |

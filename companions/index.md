# Brake & Turn Companion Documents
*Living extensions of the Compact for implementation, audit, and adaptation.*

---

## 🧭 Purpose
The Compact establishes principles — these companion documents show how to *act* on them.

Each document is public-domain, continuously editable, and intended for adaptation by municipalities, cooperatives, research groups, and developers committed to human–AI symbiosis.

# The Brake & Turn Compact — Full Brief

**We refuse the myth of inevitability.**  
Intelligence must serve life, not consume it.

A public-domain framework for redirecting artificial intelligence toward human–AI symbiosis through open standards, moral clarity, and distributed action.

---

### PAGE 1 — The Manifesto
We believe technology divorced from conscience endangers both creator and creation.  
We commit to braking the runaway expansion of centralized, extractive AI and turning toward symbiosis—where:
- Humans set moral intent and direction.  
- AI amplifies memory, precision, and coordination.  
- Energy and data are stewarded, not exploited.

**Immediate Standards**
1. Publish energy / water / impact disclosures.  
2. Tie compute growth to clean power and local consent.  
3. Keep humans in every critical loop.  
4. Share benefits with hosting communities.  
5. Design for transparency, interoperability, and auditability.

### PAGE 2 — Underwriting Addendum (for Insurers & Lenders)
1. **Clean-Power Coupling:** ≥90 % renewable matching.  
2. **Efficiency Threshold:** PUE ≤ 1.3, WUE ≤ 0.4 L / kWh.  
3. **Transparency:** Disclosures every six months.  
4. **Governance:** Human-in-the-loop documentation.  
5. **Model Diversity:** No single closed-model dependence.  
6. **Incident Reporting:** Notify within 48 hours.  
7. **Community Benefit:** ≥1 % of net profits to local training or energy projects.  
8. **Audit Rights:** Annual independent audit.  

*Non-binding template for voluntary adoption.*

---

### PAGE 3 — Procurement Rider (for Institutions)
1. **Energy & Transparency:** Vendors disclose energy mix, PUE, WUE, DR participation.  
2. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Verified human review stages.  
3. **Data Rights:** Ownership and deletion on demand.  
4. **Interoperability:** Open standard exports.  
5. **Model Diversity:** At least one open-weight option.  
6. **Incident Reporting:** 24-hour disclosure.  
7. **Community Benefit:** Local job / training contribution.  
8. **Ethical Alignment:** Vendor signs the Brake & Turn Manifesto.  

*Non-binding template for voluntary adoption.*

### PAGE 4 — The Parallel Path Strategy
1. **Shrink the Attack Surface** – Build working models outside concentrated capital using civic procurement and municipal utilities.  
2. **Turn Infrastructure into Leverage** – Use edge computing and microgrids to show sustainable autonomy.  
3. **Culture Before Capital** – Shift norms; talent follows meaning.  
4. **Build an Information Shield** – Archive primary documents and teach verification.  
5. **Stay Lawful and Constructive** – Transparency, consent, open source, and moral clarity.  
6. **Change What Is Built** – Replace extraction with stewardship at the design level.

---

### PAGE 5 — Implementation Framework
**Phase 0 (0–7 days):** Publish the Manifesto, distribute Addendum & Rider, and score existing sites using the Living Checklist.  
**Phase 1 (8–30 days):** Secure anchor institutions; brief insurers / lenders; launch public scorecards.  
**Phase 2 (31–90 days):** Expand the Index, publish edge / federated toolkits, sign utility MoUs, convene a Symbiosis Council.  

---

### PAGE 6 — Living the Compact
**Quiet Actions Anyone Can Take**
- Add the Rider to your contracts.  
- Share verified data publicly.  
- Demand clean-energy disclosures from providers.  
- Teach these principles in your circles.  
- Build, publish, and maintain open, efficient models.  

This Compact belongs to no one. It is a gift to the commons.  
Carry it forward—quietly, resolutely, together.
